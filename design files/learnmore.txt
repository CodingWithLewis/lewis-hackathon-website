What's the Deal?
Our hackathon is a 10-day event where you can dive into coding, learn new skills, and work on an exciting project with a like-minded team. This is your chance to unleash your creativity and coding skills from the comfort of your own home. Starting on July 20, we'll kick things off by announcing the theme.
